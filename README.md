# Vocab In Sentences 
**Goal**: Apply the concept of information 'redundancy' in learning of new vocabularies through word-in-sentences training.


***Project 1***: GRE vocabulary learning in sentences 
Starting with a project on GRE vocabulary learning 

Introduction: 
Drawing inspiration from Shannon's Information Theory, particularly from the concept of information 'redundancy',  to create an efficient way of memorizing GRE vocabularies through 'word-in-a-sentence' access for non-native  English speakers. The basic idea is to familiarize yourself not with the definition of a GRE-tested word, but with common ways you would likely encounter the target word in sentences.
- Data:  web scraping from google search (tentative)

Remaining issues: 
- how about words of multiple meanings?
